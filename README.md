# Daniel B Lopes da Silva

Hi, my name is Daniel and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Clemson University. My main research interests include Operations Research (OR) (particularly OR for Social Good) and the theory and applications of network optimization (interdiction, reliability, and resiliency). I am currently working in two really exciting projects: 
*   (1) modeling efficient disruption of human trafficking networks; and 
*   (2) methods for estmating the survival signature of heterogeneous networks.

I have always been involved with teaching, service and outreach. I am the current president of the INFORMS Student Chapter at Clemson University (2023-2024) after having served as its vice-president in the 2022-2023 academic term. I have also served as the secretary of the INFORMS Student Chapter at the University of Arkansas during my M.S. program there. During my undergraduate years at the Federal Unviersity of Alagoas (Brazil), I was a member (and eventually the president) of the [PET Engenharias](https://www.facebook.com/petengenharias) (Tutorial Education Program for Engineers), which consisted of a group of students guided by a faculty advisor and tasked with developing research, teaching, and outreach activities.
