- Hi, my name is Daniel and I am an Industrial Engineering Ph.D. student at Clemson University.
- I am interested in the theory and applications of network optimization.
- I am currently working in two broad projects: 
*   (1) modeling efficient disruption of human trafficking networks, 
*   (2) methods for estmating the survival signature and the reliability of heterogeneous networked systems.
