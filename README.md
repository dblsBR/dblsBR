# Daniel B Lopes da Silva
Hi, my name is Daniel and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/index.html) at Clemson University. I have always been involved with research, teaching, service and outreach. I am passionate about Engineering Education and my long-term career goal is to become a professor. Check out my pages to see some of the nice things I have been doing: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-lopes-da-silva-11a9a892/), [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/DbrunoLopes).

My CV can be found here (last update May 2024): [CV_DanielSilva](https://github.com/dblsBR/dblsBR/blob/757fe0444d31240c22ced663ce84c750a5047b28/CV_DanielSilva.pdf), and here is my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5xE4LwUAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) --- please be patient, I am just getting started :).

## Research Activities:

My main research interests include Operations Research (OR) (with a special focus in OR for Social Good) and the theory and applications of network optimization (interdiction, reliability, and resiliency). I am currently working in two really exciting projects: 
*   (1) modeling efficient disruption of human trafficking networks (with Dr. [Thomas Sharkey](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/people/faculty/sharkey.html) and Dr. [Yongjia Song](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/people/faculty/yongjis.html)); and 
*   (2) methods for estmating the survival signature of heterogeneous networks (with Dr. [Kelly Sullivan](https://industrial-engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/ksulliv/name/Kelly-Sullivan/)).

### Research Updates:
* Our paper (with Dr. Kelly Sullivan, UARK) **An Optimization-Based Monte Carlo Method for Estimating the Two-Terminal Survival Signature of Networks with Two Component Classes** was accepted for publication (July 2024) in [Naval Research Logistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15206750) and will be available online shortly. `rgb(9, 105, 218)`
*  This is a really nice paper in general, combining new and classical ideas in a smart way to develop an efficient method to estimate the survival signature of hetereogeneous networks. If you are into reliability, network flow, multi-objective optimization, or even if you are just curious in general, check it out.

I am the current president of the INFORMS Student Chapter at Clemson University (2023-2024) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/informs-clemson-student-chapter-057b62286/), [X(Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ClemsonInforms), [website](https://cecas.clemson.edu/informs/), after having served as its vice-president in the 2022-2023 academic term. I have also served as the secretary of the INFORMS Student Chapter at the University of Arkansas during my M.S. program there.

During my undergraduate years at the [Federal Unviersity of Alagoas](https://ufal.br/) (Brazil), I was a member (and eventually the president) of the PET Engenharias [1](https://www.facebook.com/petengenharias), [2](https://ufal.br/estudante/graduacao/programas/educacao-tutorial-pet/pet-engenharia) (Tutorial Education Program for Engineers), which consisted of a group of students guided by a faculty advisor and tasked with developing research, teaching, and outreach activities.
