- Hi, my name is Daniel and I am an Industrial Engineering Ph.D. candidate at Clemson University.
- I am interested in the theory and applications of network optimization (interdiction, reliability, and resiliency).
- I am currently working in two broad projects: 
*   (1) modeling efficient disruption of human trafficking networks, 
*   (2) methods for estmating the survival signature of heterogeneous networks.

- You can reach me at: dlopesd@clemson.edu
- My CV can be found here (last update May 2024): [CV_DanielLSilva](CV_DanielSilva.pdf)
