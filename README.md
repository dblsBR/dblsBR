# Daniel B Lopes da Silva

Hi, my name is Daniel and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/index.html) at Clemson University. My main research interests include Operations Research (OR) (with a special focus in OR for Social Good) and the theory and applications of network optimization (interdiction, reliability, and resiliency). I am currently working in two really exciting projects: 
*   (1) modeling efficient disruption of human trafficking networks (with Dr. [Thomas Sharkey](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/people/faculty/sharkey.html) and Dr. [Yongjia Song](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/people/faculty/yongjis.html)); and 
*   (2) methods for estmating the survival signature of heterogeneous networks (with Dr. [Kelly Sullivan](https://industrial-engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/ksulliv/name/Kelly-Sullivan/)).

I have always been involved with research, teaching, service and outreach. I am passionate about Engineering Education and my long-term career goal is to become a professor. I am the current president of the INFORMS Student Chapter at Clemson University (2023-2024) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/informs-clemson-student-chapter-057b62286/), [X(Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ClemsonInforms), [website](https://cecas.clemson.edu/informs/), after having served as its vice-president in the 2022-2023 academic term. I have also served as the secretary of the INFORMS Student Chapter at the University of Arkansas during my M.S. program there.

During my undergraduate years at the [Federal Unviersity of Alagoas](https://ufal.br/) (Brazil), I was a member (and eventually the president) of the PET Engenharias [1](https://www.facebook.com/petengenharias), [2](https://ufal.br/estudante/graduacao/programas/educacao-tutorial-pet/pet-engenharia) (Tutorial Education Program for Engineers), which consisted of a group of students guided by a faculty advisor and tasked with developing research, teaching, and outreach activities.
